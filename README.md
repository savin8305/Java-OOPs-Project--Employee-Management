# Employee Payroll System in Java

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository serves as a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in the context of Java.

## Project Highlights

- **Abstract Employee Class:** We've created an abstract Employee class that serves as the foundation for different types of employees within the system. This class encapsulates common attributes and behaviors of all employees, allowing for easy extension and customization.

- **Concrete Subclasses:** The project includes two concrete subclasses, namely FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, each demonstrating salary calculation methods. This showcases how inheritance and polymorphism are applied to model different employee types with distinct characteristics.

- **User-Friendly Terminal Interface:** We've designed an intuitive terminal interface for seamless interaction and data management. This ensures that users can easily add, view, and manipulate employee data without any hassle.

- **Core OOP Concepts in Practice:** This project is not just about theory; it's about applying core OOP principles through practical coding examples. You'll see how these concepts play a vital role in building robust and flexible software.

- **Complete Source Code:** You have access to the entire source code of the Employee Payroll System. Study it, modify it, and use it as a valuable reference for your Java programming projects.

- **Step-by-Step Guide:** To aid your understanding, we've included a step-by-step guide that explains the project's architecture, the role of each class, and how to run the system effectively.
